            <h2>BIO</h2>
            Hi there, I'm Prakrist! Currently, I'm studying IT at The British College. But before that, I went to Ideal Model School and then Prasadi Academy for my higher secondary education. Besides hitting the books, I'm really into sports. Whether it's playing or watching, sports have always been a big part of my life. I'm excited about combining my IT skills with my love for sports, like finding new ways to analyze games or using technology to improve training. I'm all about aiming high in both my studies and on the field, and I can't wait to see where this journey takes me!
